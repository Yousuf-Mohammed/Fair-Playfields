Fair-Playfields

The 'Fair Playfields' initiative in Oman is all about making football more fun and fair for everyone. It has a simple sign-up system that lets people easily join football matches. The project creates balanced teams by looking at how good each player is. This makes the games more enjoyable and competitive. Also, the initiative keeps track of how players perform, like the goals they score or the assists they make. This helps players see how they are doing and where they can improve.

A big part of the project is to find and support talented players who might play for the national team one day. Seeing these top players and their achievements can really motivate others. When players see the profiles and performances of others, especially skilled ones, it encourages them to get better too. This creates a friendly and supportive community where everyone is excited to play and get better at football.
